Youâ€™re working as a software engineer at **DeliverSwift**, a logistics and delivery company. The mobile navigation system in your app needs to calculate routes for delivery drivers based on different user preferences:

- **Fastest Route** (minimize time)
- **Shortest Route** (minimize distance)
- **Avoid Tolls**
- **Scenic Route** (maximize visual appeal)
- **Eco-Friendly Route** (optimize for fuel efficiency)

Until now, all routing logic has been hardcoded. But as the business grows, **marketing and operations teams are demanding more route options** and expect you to be able to support **easy customization and extension** without breaking existing logic.
