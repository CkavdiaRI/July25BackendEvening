"Youâ€™re building a fantasy RPG game. Each time a player creates a new character (Knight, Mage, Archer), the system has to load multiple deep attributes (weapons, AI settings, stats). Now players want to copy an existing character to create a new one with a few changes."

You must create multiple characters based on existing ones.
