### Milestone 3: Recently Viewed Items

**Objective:**  
Maintain a list of recently viewed items using `LinkedList`.

**Tasks:**

1. **Use `LinkedList<Item>` for Recently Viewed Items:**
    - Create a `LinkedList<Item>` to store recently viewed items.

2. **Add Helper Methods:**
    - `addRecentlyViewedItem(Item item)`:
        - ▪ Add the item to the list. Explore [methods](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/LinkedList.html) available in LinkedList to implement this.
        - ▪ Ensure the list size doesn’t exceed 10. Remove the oldest item if exceeded.

3. **Test Recently Viewed List:**
    - Add more than 10 items and ensure the oldest items are removed correctly.
